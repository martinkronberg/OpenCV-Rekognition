# OpenCV-Rekognition

This is an example project for using OpenCV together with AWS Rekognition


OpenCV tracks faces and monitors for smiles, when a smile is detected a picture is saved to the hard-drive, sent to AWS S3, Rekognition is invoked to analyze that picture, and the results are sent back to console.
